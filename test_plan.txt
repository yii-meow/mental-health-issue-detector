I'm so happy!
Today is the best day of my life!
I'm so excited to share this message with you!
I'm just got promoted as manager!
I feel like I cannot continue my life anymore.
The tons of homeworks are stressing me.	
I don't want to go home anymore. My parents like to scold me for no reason.
I'm so ugly and no one likes me.
