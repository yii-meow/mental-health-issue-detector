I’m so happy!
Today is the best day of my life!
I’m so excited to share this message with you!
I've just been promoted to manager!
I feel like I cannot  continue my life anymore.
The tonnes of homework are stressing me.
I don’t want to go home anymore. My parents like to scold me for no reason.
I’m so ugly, and no one likes me.
